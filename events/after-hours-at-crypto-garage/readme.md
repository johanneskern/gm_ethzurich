### INSTRUCTIONS ###
####################
# This file is a template to create new events. In order to use it, duplicate
# the whole folder (/template) as a new folder (I.E. /my-event-name) inside of
# the /events folder, using for the folder name _only_:
# - lowercase letters
# - hyphens/dashes (-) instead of spaces
# - alphanumeric characters ('a' to 'z', '0' to '9')
# and edit the README.md file inside that new folder just created.
#
# The name of the folder will be used on the URL. Example:
# https://blockchainweek.berlin/my-event-name
#
# _Don't_ rename the new file (README.md), only edit its content.
# _Don't_ remove any text before the colons at the beginning of each line,
# only edit what is after the colon. Example:
# Don't remove the word nor colon on 'description:'
#
# Every line starting with a hash symbol (#) is a comment. It will be ignored
# and can be safely removed, including these instructions.

synopsis:
  - EthereumZüri.ch is shaping up to be a major conference, featuring over 60 speakers and 500 attendees. It’s also a jam-packed program. After a full day of presentations, workshops, and panels, many will be looking for a place to unwind and recharge. That’s where EthereumZüri.ch After Hours comes in! 
  - If you are attending on 15 April (or just happen to be in town), then the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and MME (the law firm known for helping organise the original Ethereum crowd sale), along with our co-sponsors HOPR and the Multichain Asset Managers Association, would be delighted to have you join us at the Crypto Garage for a relaxed after-conference get-together. With a live DJ providing a soothing soundtrack, drinks to quench your thirst, and delectable Web3 pizza (the kind you can eat), it should be just the atmosphere to relax in while meeting conference speakers, fellow attendees, and members of the Swiss Ethereum and blockchain scene. 
  - The Crypto Garage, a converted automobile garage renowned for hosting crypto events, is located in Zürich’s Seefeld neighbourhood, not far from the conference venue and close to the Lake of Zürich. It's also within walking distance of Zürich's Niederdorf party mile if you care to continue your night out after the party ends. We do hope to see you there! But please register early, capacity is limited.
